# Adwords-Scraping
Program scrapes Google Adwords for current ads displayed for certain keywords.

Options are contained in the config folder:

devices.txt contains the device ids used in the google adwords url.
    Everything before the 'id:' is a label and is not read by the program.

keywords.txt contains the keywords used in the search.
    Each search is done on a line. If multiple searches want to be done, put keywords on different lines

regions.txt contains the location ids used in the google adwords url.
    Everything before the 'id:' is a label and is not read by the program.
